**Description**

*Pandas is an open-source data analysis and manipulation library built on top of Python. It provides data structures and functions needed to manipulate structured data seamlessly. Pandas is particularly well-suited for working with tabular data (like data from databases or spreadsheets).*

## Key Features

**DataFrame:** A 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types.

**Series:** A 1-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type.

**Handling Missing Data:** Functions to detect and fill missing data.

**Data Alignment:** Automatic and explicit data alignment for operations on different datasets.

**Group By:** Perform split-apply-combine operations on data sets.

**Reshaping:** Tools for reshaping data (pivoting).

**Merging and Joining:** Flexible methods for combining data from different sources.

**Time Series:** Powerful time-series tools for working with date and time data.
